## Overview

### The Project

**Hakaton Kotur**

This is a **responsive React web application** for a cocktail and coffee lounge bar, developed as the frontend part of a hackathon project. It communicates with a **REST API backend** to display dynamic content and handle user submissions.

**Visitors can:**

- View the bar’s menu (loaded dynamically from the API)
- Explore upcoming events (fetched from the backend)
- Submit table and hall reservation requests
- Apply for work via a job application form

The frontend is designed to be **mobile-friendly** and modern, built using **React**, styled with **CSS** and **Bootstrap**.
